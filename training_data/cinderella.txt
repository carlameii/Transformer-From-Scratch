Cinderella lived in a grand house with her cruel stepmother and her two stepsisters, Anastasia and Drizella. 
Though she was the daughter of the house, they treated her like a servant. From morning until night, she scrubbed the floors, 
washed the dishes, and made the beds, all while her stepmother and stepsisters lounged about. 
But no matter how hard life was, Cinderella remained kind and gentle, believing that someday, her dreams would come true."
One morning, an invitation arrived from the royal palace. The King was hosting a grand ball so that the Prince could find a bride. 
Cinderella’s heart leapt with joy. “Why, that means I can go too!” she said hopefully.
Her stepmother smiled slyly. “Of course, Cinderella. If you find something suitable to wear.”
Cinderella rushed to her room, pulling out a simple pink dress that had once belonged to her mother. With a few alterations, 
it would be perfect! But as she worked, her stepsisters piled more chores upon her, leaving her no time to sew.
Seeing her distress, Cinderella’s animal friends—mice, birds, and her loyal dog Bruno—secretly finished the dress for her. 
They added ribbons, lace, and beads that had been thrown away by the stepsisters. When Cinderella saw their gift, tears welled in 
her eyes. “Oh, thank you, dear friends! It’s beautiful.”
That evening, just as she was ready to leave, her stepsisters saw the dress and gasped. “Why, that’s mine!” Drizella shrieked, 
pointing to the beads. “And that sash—Anastasia, wasn’t that yours?”
Before Cinderella could react, they ripped the dress apart, leaving her in rags. Laughing cruelly, they walked away, leaving 
Cinderella heartbroken.
Sobbing in the garden, she whispered, “It’s hopeless… there’s just no use.”
Just then, a warm light appeared, and a gentle voice said, “Nonsense, child.”
Cinderella turned in shock. Before her stood a plump, kind woman holding a wand. “Now, dry those tears,” she said kindly. 
“I am your Fairy Godmother, and you’re going to the ball!”
With a flick of her wand and the words "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo!", the Fairy Godmother transformed a pumpkin into a grand carriage, 
mice into horses, and Cinderella’s torn dress into a stunning blue gown. She twirled in wonder, now wearing sparkling glass slippers.
“But remember, my dear,” the Fairy Godmother warned. “The magic will only last until midnight.”
Cinderella thanked her and climbed into the carriage, heading toward her destiny at the royal palace.
